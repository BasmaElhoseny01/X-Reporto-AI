MIMIC-CXR-Jpg
-The dataset contains 377,110 JPG format images and structured labels derived from the 227,827 free-text radiology reports associated with these images

-Creation of MIMIC-CXR-JPG involved three steps: 
(1) conversion of the DICOMs into JPG, 
(2) extraction of structured labels from free-text radiology reports associated with each image, and 
(3) creation of meta-data files providing further information regarding the images.

***Labeling of the radiology reports:
The structure of the reports is generally consistent

-The two primary sections of interest are:
1-findings; a natural language description of the important aspects in the image
2-impression; a short summary of the most immediately relevant findings.
#Custom code was written in Python 3.7 to extract the findings and impression sections for labeling by open-source tools
-Labels for the images were derived from either the impression section the findings section (if impression was not present), or the final section of the report (if neither impression nor findings sections were present)

-227,943 reports, 82.4% had an impression section, 12.5% had a findings section, and 5.1% did not have an impression or findings section

-NegBio is an open-source rule based tool for negation and uncertain detection in radiology reports
input(sentence with pre-tagged mentions of medical findings) output( finding is negative or uncertain )
-NegBio uses hand-crafted heuristic rules to search the syntactic structure (dependency graph) of each sentence in the report to determine if a mention is covered by a negated cue (e.g., “no evidence of”). If so, this mention will be marked as negative. NegBio also detects uncertain mentions of medical findings, a common occurrence in radiology reports. More detail is provided in the NegBio article [9]. The output of NegBio was saved to a CSV file with one row per study and one column per finding.
-CheXpert is an open-source rule based tool that is built on NegBio
(1) extraction: all mentions of a label are identified, including alternate spellings, synonyms, and abbreviations
(2) classification: positive, uncertain, or negative using local context
(3) aggregation: there may be multiple mentions of a label. Priority is given to positive mentions, followed by uncertain mentions, and lastly negative mentions. If a positive mention exists, then the label is positive. Conversely, if a negative and uncertain mention exist, the label is uncertain. These stages are used to define all labels except "No Finding"
-The output of CheXpert was saved to a CSV file with one row per study and one column per finding.
-When CheXpert or NegBio were unable to derive a label no label is generated and no row appears for the study in the CSV
***Data Description Overview
-10 folders, each with ~6,500 sub-folders corresponding to all the JPG format images for an individual patient.
-mimic-cxr-2.0.0-metadata.csv.gz => a compressed CSV file providing useful metadata for the images ( including view position, patient orientation, and an anonymized date of image acquisition time allowing chronological ordering of the images.)
-mimic-cxr-2.0.0-split.csv.gz => a compressed CSV file providing recommended train/validation/test data splits.
-mimic-cxr-2.0.0-chexpert.csv.gz => a compressed CSV file listing all studies with labels generated by the CheXpert labeler.
-mimic-cxr-2.0.0-negbio.csv.gz => a compressed CSV file listing all studies with labels generated by the NegBio labeler.

***Metadata files
mimic-cxr-2.0.0-metadata.csv.gz 
-Columns
1-dicom_id - An identifier for the DICOM file. The stem of each JPG image filename is equal to the dicom_id.
2-PerformedProcedureStepDescription - The type of study performed ("CHEST (PA AND LAT)", "CHEST (PORTABLE AP)", etc).
3-ViewPosition - The orientation in which the chest radiograph was taken ("AP", "PA", "LATERAL", etc).
4-Rows - The height of the image in pixels.
5-Columns - The width of the image in pixels.
6-StudyDate X- An anonymized date for the radiographic study. All images from the same study will have the same date and time. Dates are anonymized, but chronologically consistent for each patient. Intervals between two scans have not been modified during de-identification.
7-StudyTime - The time of the study in hours, minutes, seconds, and fractional seconds. The time of the study was not modified during de-identification.
8-ProcedureCodeSequence_CodeMeaning - The human readable description of the coded procedure (e.g. "CHEST (PA AND LAT)". Descriptions follow Simon-Leeming codes [11].
9-ViewCodeSequence_CodeMeaning - The human readable description of the coded view orientation for the image (e.g. "postero-anterior", "antero-posterior", "lateral").
10-PatientOrientationCodeSequence_CodeMeaning - The human readable description of the patient orientation during the image acquisition. Three values are possible: "Erect", "Recumbent", or a null value (missing).

mimic-cxr-2.0.0-split.csv.gz
-Columns
1-dicom_id - An identifier for the DICOM file. The stem of each JPG image filename is equal to the dicom_id.
2-study_id - An integer unique for an individual study (i.e. an individual radiology report with one or more.
3-subject_id - An integer unique for an individual patient.
4-split - a string field indicating the data split for this file, one of 'train', 'validate', or 'test'.
***Structured labels
- 16 column
1-subject_id - An integer unique for an individual patient
2- study_id - An integer unique for an individual study (i.e. an individual radiology report with one or more images associated with it)
The remaining columns are labels as presented in the CheXpert article [8]:

Atelectasis
Cardiomegaly
Consolidation
Edema
Enlarged Cardiomediastinum
Fracture
Lung Lesion
Lung Opacity
Pleural Effusion
Pneumonia
Pneumothorax
Pleural Other
Support Devices
No Finding

Each label column contains one of four values: 1.0, -1.0, 0.0, or missing
1.0 - The label was positively mentioned in the associated study, and is present in one or more of the corresponding images e.g. "A large pleural effusion"
0.0 - The label was negatively mentioned in the associated study, and therefore should not be present in any of the corresponding images e.g. "No pneumothorax."
-1.0 - The label was either: (1) mentioned with uncertainty in the report, and therefore may or may not be present to some degree in the corresponding image, or (2) mentioned with ambiguous language in the report and it is unclear if the pathology exists or not
Explicit uncertainty: "The cardiac size cannot be evaluated."
Ambiguous language: "The cardiac contours are stable."
Missing (empty element) - No mention of the label was made in the report
